    <h1>Where Did I Live Guessing Game!</h1>

    <h2>This is a guessing game where you get to guess which states I have lived in outside of Washington
    State!</h2>

    <h3>How the game works:</h3>
    <p>This game works by using a prompt to ask the user questions about whether or not I lived in a particular state. After the user inputs an answer to the question an alert shows up saying where or not the user got the question right or not. It then takes note of the users score by adding one point to the score variable for each correct answer. Once the game is over an alert pops up displaying the users score.</p>
